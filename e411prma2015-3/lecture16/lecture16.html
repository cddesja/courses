					<h3>Last time</h3>
					<p>Different models of intelligence</p>
					<p>Spearman's <em>g</em>; Cattell &amp Horn's broad domains; Carroll's hierarchical view; CHC; processing view of intelligence </p>
					<p><font color ="#1b91ff">Does it really matter how we define intelligence?</font></p>
					<p><font color ="#1b91ff">Is it more academic than practical?</font></p>

				<h2>Stanford-Binet IQ test</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Conceived to screen for developmental disabilities</li>
						<li>Provided organized administration/scoring instructions</li>
						<li>Originally intelligence calculated as the ratio of mental age to true age (IQ)</li>
						<li>Deviation IQ, mean of 100 and standard deviation of 16 (now 15), comparison of an individual with other of the same age in the standardization sample</li>
						<li>Used  <font color ="#1b91ff">age scale</font>, grouping by items by age; <font color ="#1b91ff">point scale</font>, grouping of items by category that could be scored correct or incorrect </li>
						<li>Scores can be obtained as a <font color ="#1b91ff">test composite</font> (e.g. IQ)</li>
						<!-- <li>Measures fluid reasoning (fluid), knowledge (crystallized), quantitative knowledge, visual-spatial, and working memory (see Table 10 - 2)</li> -->
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h2><a href="http://www.riverpub.com/products/sb5/details.html">Fifth edition</a></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>For 2 to 85+ year olds</li>
						<li>Measures fluid reasoning, knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spating processing, and working memory (table 10-2).</li>
						<li>10 subtests, each about 5 minutes (M = 10; SD = 3) </li>
						<li>Scores can be use to create various composites: factor index; nonverbal and verbal IQ; abbreviated battery IQ; and FSIQ</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Uses of SB5</h3>
					<ul style="font-size:90%">
					<li>Diagnose a range of development disabilities and exceptionalities</li>
					<li>Clinical and neuropsychological assessment</li>
					<li>Early childhood assessment</li>
					<li>Psychoeducational evaluations for special education placements</li>
					<li>Adult social security and workers? compensation evaluations</li>
					<li>Providing information for interventions such as IFSPs, IEPs, career assessment, industrial selection, and adult neuropsychological treatment</li>
					<li>Forensic contexts</li>
					<li>Research on abilities and aptitudes</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				

				<section style="font-size:85%">
				<h3>Validity evidence for SB5</h3>
				<p> Normative sample: 4,800 individuals between 2 and 85+ years (to match the 2000 U.S. Census)<p>
				<p> Bias reviews were conducted on all items for the following variables: gender, ethnicity, culture, religion, region, and socioeconomic status.</p>
				<p> Co-normed with with the Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test, Second Edition and the Test Observation Form<p>
				<p>For the FSIQ, NVIQ, and VIQ, reliabilities range from .95 to .98. 
				<p> Reliabilities for the Factor Indexes range from .90 to .92.</p>
				<p> For the 10 subtests, reliabilities range from .84 to .89.</p>
				<p> Concurrent and criterion validity data were obtained using the SB-IV,SB-LM, WJ III, UNIT, Bender-Gestalt II, WPPSI-R,WAIS-III, WIAT®-II, and WISC-III.<p>

					In the United States, historically, the purpose of education has evolved according to the needs of society. Education's primary purpose has ranged from instructing youth in religious doctrine, to preparing them to live in a democracy, to assimilating immigrants into mainstream society, to preparing workers for the industrialized 20th century workplace.

					<blockquote cite="http://www.ascd.org/publications/newsletters/education-update/jul12/vol54/num07/What-Is-the-Purpose-of-Education%C2%A2.aspx"> 
					I think that my view, and most people's view, is that the purpose of education is to support children in developing the skills, the knowledge, and the dispositions that will allow them to be responsible, contributing members of their community—their democratically-informed community. Meaning, to be a good friend, to be a good mate, to be able to work, and to contribute to the well-being of the community.

					* Educational opportunities for all students
					* One measurement of NCLB, adequate yearly progress is a measurement used to determine how every public school and school district is performing according to results on a standardized exam.
						* Yearly progress towards 100% proficiency (student is working successfully on grade level material)
						* Proficiency measured by standardized assessment

					## MN AYP
					* For Minnesota, in 2010, "Adequate Yearly Progress" (AYP) is measured by splitting students into 27 subgroups, based on the subject area and students' ethnicity. (Hispanic students' performance on math is one example). If students in just one of those subgroups don't meet proficiency benchmarks, the entire school is considered "Not Making AYP."
