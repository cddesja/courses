				<h2>How could we use tests in business and careers?</h2>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Career Interest and Choice</h3>
                	<p class = "fragment">We may want to gauge someone's propensity towards a career</p>
					<p class = "fragment">Want to quantify their interest relative to professionals </p>
					<p class = "fragment"><font color = "#3EA055">assumption</font> - if your interest are similar to someone in the field than you would be interested in that field</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<h3>Strong Interest Inventory</h3>
					<p class = "fragment"><font color = "#3EA055">How would you create such an instrument?</font></p>
                    <p class="fragment">Write and select a bunch of diverse items meant to distinguish between people in different fields</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Administer this exhaustive instrument to people from various fields that you want to be able to talk about it</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Keep only the items that have high discriminative validity</p>
                    <p class="fragment">Administer the test to job seekers that told them which careers match their interest given their response pattern</p>
                    <p class="fragment"><font color = "#3EA055">Would want to make sure the instrument was tailored to your population</font> (e.g. their education level, age, whether they want a nonprofessional career, disabilities, etc)</p>     
				</section>

				<section data-background="#006DB0" data-background-transition="zoom">
				<h4 class="fragment">How could we assess the validity of such an inventory?</h4>
				<h4 class="fragment">Does interest equal aptitude?</h4>
				<h4 class="fragment">Which is more important to career success: aptitude or interest?</h4>
				</section>


				<section>
				<h3>Aptitude tests</h3>
				<ul>
					<li class = "fragment">These may be traditional paper and pencil, on a computer, or involve demonstrating dexterity </li>
					<li class = "fragment">Could measure mathematical skill, abstract thought, spatial skills, use of certain tools, motor skills, etc</li>
					<li class = "fragment">The <font color = "#3EA055">General Aptitude Test Battery (GATB)</font>, most widely utilized aptitude test</li>
                    <li class="fragment">Original used cutoffs and validity studies</li>
					<li class = "fragment">Uses regression and <font color = "#ff2c2d">validity generalization</font> to make recommendations based on test results</li>
                    <li class="fragment">Hunter developed 5 families of jobs and used regression to within a family to make recommendations</li> 
				</ul>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h3>GATB</h3>
					<p class = "fragment"> <font color = "#ff2c2d">validity generalization</font> implies that the same GATB score could be predictive of aptitude a cluster of jobs </p>
					<p class="fragment">strong overlap and high homogeneity in a cluster</p>
					<p class="fragment">For example, need to only test if you have the aptitude to be a counseling psychologist to find out that clinicial psychology could work for you</p>
					<p class="fragment">GATB consists of 9 aptitudes: verbal, numerical, spatial, form perception, clerical perception, motor coordination, finger dexterity, and manual dexterity
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">These abilities are then composited to create three scales, which are used to predict job proficiency</p>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#000000" data-background-transition="zoom">
				<h5>The downside, GATB has traditionally used race norming</h5>
				</section>

				<section data-background="#006DB0" data-background-transition="zoom">
				<h5 class="fragment">What could be the role of personality assessment?</h5>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h3>Personality traits</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment"> Employers may wish to administer a personality assessment to see if prospective employees fits within the business</li>
						<li class="fragment"><font color = "#3EA055">What might be the problem with this?</font></li>
						<li class="fragment">May wish to administer an <font color = "#ff2c2d">integrity test</font></li>
						<li class="fragment"><font color = "#3EA055">Perhaps the most valid test is the one with the least amount of face validity?</font></li>
					
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Personality types</h3>
					<p class="fragment"><a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/">Meyers-Briggs</a> has been employed a lot!</p>
					<p class="fragment">Based on Jung work, items measure your "preferences" (e.g. Extraversion or Interversion) and from your preferences come your <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/">personality type</a></p>

					<p class="fragment">Psychometric soundness is debatable</p>
					<p class="fragment">The link between personality is not clear and depends on definition of work performance</p>
					<p class="fragment">However, high conscientiousness and extroversion and low neuroticism generally correlated with high work performance</p>

                <section>
				<h3> More uses in business</h3>

						<li class="fragment"> Can be used to <font color = "#ff2c2d">screen</font> candidates relatively to some criteria</li>
						<li class="fragment"> Can <font color = "#ff2c2d">select</font> candidates for a position</li>
						<li class="fragment">Could be used to <font color = "#ff2c2d">classify</font> candidates in categories</li>
						<li class="fragment">Could be used to <font color = "#ff2c2d">place</font> candidates in programs, tracts, etc </li>
						<li class="fragment">Could use interest, aptitude, ability, or personality tests to do any of these</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
